            <h2 class="section-heading">My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My programming journey began four years ago, and I've since explored a wide range of languages and tools. I'm currently a high school student enrolled in AP Computer Science A, following my completion of AP CSP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I've focused on Java and front-end interface design, expanding my skills in creating responsive, polished user experiences. For a class project in CSA, I designed and implemented a login system and dynamic profile pages using Tailwind CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the backend side, I integrated both Python and Java to support authentication and data handling, giving me hands-on experience with multi-language backend support and real-world development pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also interning with my school district (PUSD), where I contribute to real-world development efforts that directly benefit students. One of my key projects involved working closely with Kasm and AWS to build a cloud-based platform for students using Chromebooks or underpowered computers. This system allows them to run resource-intensive applications remotely and stay on pace with classroom instruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, I learned the inner workings of Kasm Workspaces, including how to customize Linux-based container images to suit student needs. I also worked on integrating secure connections between Kasm environments and AWS S3 storage, learning encryption techniques and security best practices to protect student data. Additionally, I gained experience in configuring infrastructure to link AWS services with Kasm servers, creating a stable and scalable remote computing environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside the classroom, I enjoy building personal projects, participating in hackathons, and exploring areas like machine learning, web development, and game design. My ultimate goal is to use technology to make a positive impact and solve real-world problems.
